What is C++?
C++ is a cross-platformed language that can be used to create sophisticated high-performance applications.
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell labs in 1979, as an extension to the C language.
C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.
C++ is a popular programming language.
C++ is used to create computer programs.
C++ is an object oriented language.

Why Use C++
C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
C++ is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
C++ is fun and easy to learn!
===============================================================================================
The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as "a light-weight abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions";[7] and "offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages."[48]
C++ inherits most of C's syntax. The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that uses the C++ Standard Library stream facility to write a message to standard output:

// This is a comment. It's for *people* to read, not computers. It's usually used to describe the program.
// Make the I/O standard library available for use in the program.
#include <iostream>
// We are now defining the main function; it is the function run when the program starts.
int main()
{
    // Printing a message to the screen using the standard output stream std::cout.
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
}
This is how we write any c++ programming code.
